		<b>CHICKEN:-------</b>	
		Chickens (Gallus domesticus) are domestic birds that cannot fly. There are over 150 different breeds of chicken that come in various colours, patterns and sizes. The chicken is believed to have descended from the wild Indian and south-east Asian Red Junglefowl which is biologically classified as the same species.
		With a population of more than 24 billion in 2003, there are more chickens in the world than any other bird. Chickens provide two sources of food frequently consumed by humans: their meat, also known as chicken, and eggs which they lay.

		<b>BEEF:-------</b>
		This review of the beef food chain revealed that men are eating too much beef and women are eating too little. It also highlighted that consumers have enhanced confidence in the beef food chain on the island and the industry enforcement controls that are in place.
		The review outlines that while beef remains extremely popular and that three out of four people on the island eat it regularly, the average portion size consumed during a meal is 121g with men consuming more than women. This intake far exceeds health professional recommendations of 57g in a single portion of lean, red meat, or ideally one ninth of your dinner plate.

		<b>SUSHI:-------</b>
		Technically, the word sushi refers to the rice (the Japanese word su means vinegar, and shi is from meshi, the Japanese word for rice, hence sushi is ‘vinegared rice’), but colloquially, the term is used to describe a finger-size piece of raw fish or shellfish on a bed of rice or simply the consumption of raw fish in the Japanese style (while sushi is not solely a Japanese invention, these days, the Japanese style is considered the de facto serving standard). This can be eaten as is, or is often dipped into shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) and then eaten. Great care is taken in the creation of the dish and the many methods of preparing the food indicate the importance of appearance to the educated consumer.
